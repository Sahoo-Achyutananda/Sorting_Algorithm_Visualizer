I learned a few new things - 

1. AbortController()
2. window.onload only works when the site is loaded for the first time, on reloading - the function doesnt trigger at all.
3. difference between localStorage and sessionStorage API 

    sessionStorage:The sessionStorage API is a browser-based storage mechanism that allows you to store key-value pairs for a specific session. This means that the data stored in sessionStorage is only available while the browser tab or window is open, and it's cleared when the tab or window is closed. 
    It's designed for temporary data that needs to be accessible during a user's browsing session
4. Buttons and links 
-> for webpages on the internet use onclick = "window.location.href = 'https:// ........'"
-> for local use : onclick = "location.href = './......./........html'"

if we want to open a webpage of internet in a new tab - use window.open(URL, '_BLANK')

window.open('https://example.com', '_blank');




CHALLENGES FACED - 
1. find a way to trigger a function on reload - 

ANS : window.loaction.reload() only reloads the page , doesnt
invoke any function ... therfore use it along with the combination of sessionStorage
-> this works only when a button on the page initiates the reload

-> another solution was to use the "performance" object - it returns the performance based attributes as an object

window.addEventListener('load', () => {
    if (performance.navigation.type === 1) {
        // Reload detected
        yourFunctionOnReload();
    }
});

.navigation is deprecated .. i used this instead

window.addEventListener('load', () => {
    if (performance.getEntriesByType('navigation') === 'reload') {
        // Reload detected
        fillContainer();
    }
});


2. was getting wrong results due to a fixed transition set in the css ... Added transition based on the speed 
set by the user dynamically using JS.

3. Merge Sort implementation was very Tricky !

-> In your original code, merge reads heights from the DOM (which are dynamically changing), causing later mergeSort calls to process partially merged data instead of the original unsorted subarrays. This breaks the divide-and-conquer logic of merge sort.
